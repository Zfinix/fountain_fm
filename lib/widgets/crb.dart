/// A rectangle border with continuous corners.
///
/// A shape similar to a rounded rectangle, but with a smoother transition from
/// the sides to the rounded corners.
///
/// The rendered shape roughly approximates that of a superellipse. In this
/// shape, the curvature of each 90º corner around the length of the arc is
/// approximately a gaussian curve instead of a step function as with a
/// traditional quarter circle round. The rendered rectangle is roughly a
/// superellipse with an n value of 5.
///
/// In an attempt to keep the shape of the rectangle the same regardless of its
/// dimension (and to avoid clipping of the shape), the radius will
/// automatically be lessened if its width or height is less than ~3x the
/// declared radius. The new resulting radius will always be maximal in respect
/// to the dimensions of the given rectangle.
///
/// To achieve the corner smoothness with this shape, ~50% more pixels in each
/// dimensions are used to render each corner. As such, the ~3 represents twice
/// the ratio (ie. ~3/2) of a corner's declared radius and the actual height and
/// width of pixels that are used to construct it. For example, if a
/// rectangle had and a corner radius of 25, in reality ~38 pixels in each
/// dimension would be used to construct a corner and so ~76px x ~76px would be
/// the minimal size needed to render this rectangle.
///
/// This shape will always have 4 linear edges and 4 90º curves. However, for
/// rectangles with small values of width or height (ie.  <20 lpx) and a low
/// aspect ratio (ie. <0.3), the rendered shape will appear to have just 2
/// linear edges and 2 180º curves.
///
/// The example below shows how to render a continuous rectangle on screen.
///
/// {@tool sample}
